##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 31, 2022 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple HTML/CSS (Grid) landing page - [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl)

**Thoughts** This week marks the start of my final capstone project for Merit America. While we get the framework and user journey worked out, I want to continue to practice my front-end skills and add to my portfolio.

### Day 2: November 1, 2022 - Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: My coding today centered around working with some React components for a responsive navbar. 

**Thoughts**: My final Capstone project kicks off tomorrow, so I've been trying to keep the coding to more simplistic challenges so that I don't get burnt out.
