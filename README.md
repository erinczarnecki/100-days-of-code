# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Contents

* [Rules](rules.md)
* [Log - click here to see my progress](Daily-Log.md)

### Challenge Format:

1.  Commit to the [Log](Daily-Log.md) daily.
2.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
3.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
4.  **Share your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
5.  Encourage others who are doing the same challenge by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
